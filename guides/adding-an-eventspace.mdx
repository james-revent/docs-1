**What is an Eventspace?**

An EventSpace in Revent represents a single event within an organization, group, or community. It serves as a dedicated space to manage all details and settings related to that event. You can create multiple EventSpaces for different events under the same organization, making it easier to keep everything organized and separated by event.

**Creating an EventSpace**

To add an EventSpace, follow these steps:
1. **Click the “Add EventSpace” Button**: Navigate to your EventSpaces page and click on the “Add EventSpace” button.
2. **Choose a Name**: Enter a name that represents your event.
3. **Configure the EventSpace**: Once created, your new EventSpace will appear on the EventSpaces page. To modify settings like labels, icons, or to manage your team’s collaboration settings, click on the three dots in the top-right corner of the EventSpace card.

Once your EventSpace has been created, you can start setting up the details for each event within it. 

1. **Navigate to the Event**: On the left-hand navigation bar, click on the specific event you want to set up within your EventSpace.
2. **Enter Event Information**: You will be prompted to fill out essential details, such as the eventâ€™s name, date, time, and description. This information helps define the structure of your event.

4. **AI Writer Assistant**: If you need help drafting content, use the built-in AI Writer Assistant to automatically generate descriptions, announcements, or other content for the event.

With these steps, you can easily structure and document all necessary details for your events within the EventSpace, making collaboration and organization seamless for your entire team.

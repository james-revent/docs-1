A Task Board helps your team collaborate and organize tasks for the event to ensure everything runs smoothly. When creating a Task Board, you can choose from:
- **Featured Task Boards**: Pre-made boards with tasks and categories tailored for different event scenarios.
- **Community Task Boards**: Boards created and shared by other users.
- **Blank Board**: Create your own custom Task Board from the ground up.
